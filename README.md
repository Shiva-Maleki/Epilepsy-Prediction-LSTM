# Model 862 ‚Äì Patient-Specific Seizure Prediction Using LSTM (European iEEG Dataset)

This project presents a patient-specific seizure prediction model using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from the **European iEEG dataset**, focusing on **Patient 862**. The analysis is part of a larger study conducted across **26 patients**, with the goal of developing lightweight and reliable models optimized for **wearable and implantable devices**.

## üìä Project Overview

Our model follows a multi-step pipeline (illustrated in the accompanying figure) that includes signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using various LSTM-based architectures. To evaluate the trade-off between **model complexity and performance**, we tested **five different model configurations**.

## üîç Results for Patient 862

- **Patient Profile**: 16-year-old female with a 4-year seizure history  
- **Seizure Type**: All recorded seizures are **secondarily generalized**  
- **Subclinical Seizures**: None reported, contributing to model performance  

### ‚úÖ Best Performing Model (Model-1)

| Metric       | Value    |
|--------------|----------|
| AUC          | **1.00** |
| False Positive Rate (FPR) | **0.01** |
| Accuracy     | **99.2%** |

Model-1 demonstrated exceptional predictive performance for Patient 862. The absence of subclinical seizures and the presence of consistent seizure types contributed to this result.
